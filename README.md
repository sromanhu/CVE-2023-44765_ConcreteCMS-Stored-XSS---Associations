### POC:


When logging into the panel, we will go to the "System & Settings - Data Objects." section off General Menu.

We edit the Entity field with the payload that we have created and see that we can inject arbitrary Javascript code in the Plural Handle field.


### XSS Payload:

```js
""><svg/onload=alert('PluralHandle')>
```


Then we add an association:

And we add the Type to Many to Many to add the payload to "Target Property Name and Inversed Property Name":

We execute the association created:

In the following image you can see the embedded code that executes the payload in the main web.
